# Changelog

## [22.26.0] - 2026-09-23

### Changed

- **BREAKING: the Angular floor rises from 18.0 to 18.1, so Angular 18.0.x is no longer supported.**
  The table and list templates use `@let`, which Angular did not ship until 18.1, so `>=18.0.0` was
  a promise this package could not keep: an application on 18.0.x failed to compile with a template
  error that pointed nowhere useful. The range says `>=18.1.0` now, which turns a confusing build
  failure into the install-time warning it should always have been. See `BREAKING_CHANGES.md`.
- **The floor is derived and checked from now on.** `npm run peers:floors` works it out from the
  Angular APIs the source calls, the `minVersion` markers in the compiled output and the Angular
  types that reach the published `.d.ts`, and CI fails when a declaration drifts away from it.

## [22.25.0] - 2026-09-22

### Fixed

- **The table says how it is sorted.** `aria-sort` did not appear anywhere in the package: the
  only sign of which column ordered the rows was an icon class on an element marked
  `aria-hidden`, so a screen reader announced that a table had been reordered and never by
  what. Every sortable column now carries `ascending`, `descending` or `none`, and a column
  that cannot be sorted carries nothing rather than offering an action it does not have.
- **The sort control is drawn only where it sorts.** It was rendered for any column that had
  either sorting or a menu filter, so a column with only a filter got a focusable button with
  no name and no effect. A consumer styling `.hub-table__sort-btn` on such a column will find
  the element gone.
- **Every control has a name.** The sort button, the row checkbox and radio, the select-all
  box, the control that opens a row and each column filter were all unnamed; the page-size
  select was named only when a form-controls adapter was registered. The labels are
  translated, the expander also reports `aria-expanded`, and the page-size select is tied to
  the label that was already beside it.
- **The head row is a head row, and loading is audible.** The `<th>` elements carry
  `scope="col"`, the table reports `aria-busy` while it loads, the row count is a live region
  so a page change is announced, and the paginator marks the page the reader is on with
  `aria-current`.
- **The documentation stops promising resizable columns.** `HubResizableComponent` and
  `HubResizableDirective` are exported, but `<hub-table>` never imported them, so the
  `resizable` attribute the table wrote on every header cell matched nothing and no border was
  ever draggable. The attribute is gone from the rendered `<th>`, and the README, the Spanish
  README and `FUNCTIONALITIES.md` now say what the table does instead of what it was meant to
  do. The two pieces stay exported for anyone building their own grid; wiring them in, with a
  per-column opt-in, is still open work.
- **The selection column decides once.** The head row asked for `selectable()` while the filter
  row and the body row asked for `selectable() || batchActions.length` — the second half of
  which read a property off the input signal itself, not off the array, and so was always
  false. The behaviour never differed, but the three conditions now read alike, and a spec
  pins head, filters and body to the same width.

### Added

- **Six label keys, in all eleven bundled languages**: `SORT_BY`, `FILTER_BY`,
  `SELECT_ALL_ROWS`, `SELECT_ROW`, `EXPAND_ROW` and `COLLAPSE_ROW`. `SORT_BY` and `FILTER_BY`
  take a `column` parameter, so each control is named after the column it acts on.
- **`ariaSortFor(header)` and `columnName(header)` on `HubTableComponent`**, which is how the
  template builds those labels. A title given as an observable cannot be read synchronously,
  so `columnName` falls back to the property name rather than printing an object.

## [22.24.0] - 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- **The empty-state notice paints itself, and follows the theme.** It was an `alert alert-info`
  borrowed from Bootstrap, which this family does not ship: without Bootstrap the notice
  rendered as bare text against the page, its icon stacked above the sentence, and with
  Bootstrap it stayed a pale blue panel with dark blue text in a dark theme. It carries its own
  rules now, built from the design system's informative roles — `--hub-sys-color-info-subtle`
  for the fill and `--hub-sys-color-info-border-subtle` for the edge, both of which mix against
  the page surface and so follow the theme. The text is `--hub-sys-text-primary` rather than the
  matching emphasis role, which the design system calibrates for text on white and which lands
  near 2:1 on the panel a dark theme produces; measured after the change, the sentence sits at
  14.3:1 in light and 14.6:1 in dark.

### Added

- **Eight tokens for that notice**, so it can be themed like everything else the table draws:
  `--hub-table-no-data-bg`, `--hub-table-no-data-color`, `--hub-table-no-data-border-color`,
  `--hub-table-no-data-border-width`, `--hub-table-no-data-border-radius`,
  `--hub-table-no-data-padding`, `--hub-table-no-data-margin` and `--hub-table-no-data-gap`.

## [22.23.0] - 2026-09-20

### Added

- **Three tokens to give the paging bar air, off by default.** The bar sits flush against the
  grid and against its own edges, and `justify-content` cannot change that: `space-around`
  shares the free space out between the items and leaves none outside them, so the paginator
  ends up against one edge and the row count against the other however it is set. The gutter
  has to be padding. `--hub-table-bottom-bar-padding-block`,
  `--hub-table-bottom-bar-padding-inline` and `--hub-table-bottom-bar-spacing` hold it — the
  last one separating the bar from the grid on whichever side it is drawn — and
  `hub-table-theme()` takes them as `$footer-padding-block`, `$footer-padding-inline` and
  `$footer-spacing`. All three are `0`, so no existing table moves; a table that wants the band
  asks for it.

### Fixed

- **The table follows the dark theme.** Every surface it paints — the cells, the header, the
  toolbar, the search field, the filter controls, the clear-filters button — fell back to
  `--hub-ref-color-white`, and a reference token is precisely the one thing no theme redefines.
  A dark application therefore got light text on white cells: the grid was unreadable, and
  nothing in the console said so. Those surfaces fall back to `--hub-sys-surface-page` now, and
  the quiet ones in the list and the paginator to `--hub-sys-surface-elevated`. In the light
  theme both resolve to the same `#ffffff` and `#f8f9fa` the literals carried, so nothing moves;
  in a dark one the table finally reads. A `--hub-table-bg` set by the application still wins,
  exactly as before.

    Two literal whites stay: the count on a filter chip and the label of the active page, which
    sit on the accent rather than on a surface. Those belong to the accent's own contrast colour
    and are a separate fix.

- **A header cell keeps its title, its sort control and its filter on one line.** The row was
  laid out by Bootstrap utility classes written in the template, and this family ships no
  Bootstrap: in an application without it the three stacked one under another in every sortable
  column, and the filter ended up below the arrows. The cell carries its own rules now, with
  `--hub-table-header-cell-gap` and `--hub-table-header-cell-actions-gap` holding the spacing.
  The same seam is closed one row down, on a row's action buttons and their icon and label —
  `--hub-table-cell-buttons-gap` and `--hub-table-cell-btn-content-gap`. An application that
  does load Bootstrap sees no change: the declared values are the ones the utilities applied.

## [22.22.1] - 2026-09-16

### Changed

- The repository moved to the `hub-env` organization. Issues for every Hub UI package are now
  gathered in [hub-env/hub-ui](https://github.com/hub-env/hub-ui/issues), and the `repository`, `bugs`
  and README links point at the new addresses. GitHub redirects the old ones.

## [22.22.0] - 2026-09-08

### Changed

- **The icon component is `HubPaginableIconComponent`, and `<hub-icon>` is no longer one of its
  element names.** `ng-hub-ui-icons` exports a `HubIconComponent` matching `hub-icon` too, so the
  two packages were claiming one class name and one tag. The tag was the expensive half: a
  component importing both and writing `<hub-icon>` did not compile at all — Angular rejected the
  template with NG8023, "Multiple components match node with tagname hub-icon" — which reads as a
  bug in the application rather than as two libraries colliding, and has no fix a consumer can
  apply from outside.

    This one keeps `<ng-hub-ui-icon>`, which it has always matched, and gains
    `<hub-paginable-icon>`; `<hub-icon>` now belongs to `ng-hub-ui-icons` alone. The class is
    exported under its new name, with `HubIconComponent` kept as a deprecated alias that goes in
    23.0.0. The component itself is unchanged — same `config` input, same output.

    **Breaking** for a template writing `<hub-icon [config]>` — see
    [`BREAKING_CHANGES.md`](./BREAKING_CHANGES.md).

## [22.21.0] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- **`placement` on `hub-paginator`, so two paginators are not one name twice.** A `<nav>` is a
  landmark, and with `paginationPosition="both"` the table drew two of them announcing the same
  "Pagination": a screen reader listed two identical regions and offered no way to choose between
  them. Each bar now says which end of the table it sits at — "Pagination, at the top" and
  "Pagination, at the bottom", translated in every dictionary the package ships — while a lone
  paginator keeps the plain name it always had, because there is nothing to tell it apart from.
  The input is optional and unset by default; a paginator used on its own is unchanged.

### Fixed

- **The JSDoc of five components reaches the published `.d.ts`.** `ListComponent`,
  `TableComponent`, `PaginatorComponent`, `ResizableComponent` and
  `PaginableTableRangeInputComponent` carried their class documentation between the decorator and
  the class, where TypeScript associates it with nothing: it was dropped from the type
  declarations, so a consumer hovering any of them in an editor got no description at all. The
  comments now sit above the decorator and travel with the build. Nothing about the API changes.

## [22.20.0] - 2026-09-07

### Removed

- **The `TooltipDirective` re-export.** The directive lived in `ng-hub-ui-utils` and was
  re-exported here for the consumers who had imported it from this package before it moved. It
  is gone from `ng-hub-ui-utils` 22.14.0 — a bare `[tooltip]` selector is a name in the
  application's namespace, not a library's — so there is nothing left to forward. Nothing in
  this library used it: the table draws its own tooltips through `HubTableTooltipDirective`,
  which is unaffected.

    **Breaking** for an application importing `TooltipDirective` from `ng-hub-ui-paginable` —
    see [`BREAKING_CHANGES.md`](./BREAKING_CHANGES.md).

## [22.19.1] - 2026-09-07

### Changed

- **The documentation says where the keyboard marks a row.** With `selectWhileSelecting` on and
  no `clickFn`, the row carries no `tabindex` — which reads as a keyboard hole, and was reported
  as one. It is not: every row of a selectable table already draws its own checkbox, a native
  control that sits in the natural tab order and marks the row when it is ticked, so the row
  click is a pointer shortcut for a path the keyboard has had all along. Giving the row a stop of
  its own would double the tab stops of a two-hundred-row table to reach something already
  reachable, which is worse for everybody. Nothing in the behaviour changes; the input's
  documentation, both READMEs and `FUNCTIONALITIES.md` now say it, and a test pins it so the
  next reader does not have to re-derive it.

## [22.19.0] - 2026-09-06

### Changed

- **Single selection draws a radio, not a checkbox.** With `[selectable]="true"` and no `[multiple]`,
  the table drew a checkbox per row and then released the previous pick when a second one was
  ticked. A checkbox says the rows are independent, so the control was describing something the
  table does not do, and a screen reader announced it that way too. `hub-list` in this same package
  has always drawn a radio here. The radios of one table share a name of that table's own, so two
  single-selection tables on a page do not fight over one choice, and clicking the chosen radio
  again still clears the selection, which a native radio cannot do on its own. Multiple selection
  is untouched. See `BREAKING_CHANGES.md`.

### Fixed

- **The select-all box in the header lines up with the boxes in the rows again.** 22.18.0 gave the
  row checkbox the whole cell as its hit area, wrapped in a label that centres it. The header kept
  a bare `<input>`, so the two were centred by different rules and the selection column read as two
  columns that did not quite meet. The header now wears the same label, which also gives the
  select-all box the generous hit area the row boxes got.

## [22.18.0] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- **A clickable row can be reached and activated from the keyboard.** A row given `clickFn` is a
  control in every way except the one that matters to somebody not holding a mouse: it had no tab
  stop and answered to no key, so the action simply was not there for them. The row now takes focus
  when `clickFn` is set and runs on Enter and Space. It keeps its implicit `row` role rather than
  taking `role="button"` — the row already contains a checkbox and action buttons, and a button
  role would nest interactive controls and cost the table its grid semantics. The handler acts only
  when the row itself has focus, so ticking a checkbox with the keyboard no longer opens the record.

- **The table and the list accept a resource whole, with `[resource]`.** Feeding either of them
  from a `resource()` or an `httpResource()` meant three bindings — the value, `isLoading()` and
  `error()` — that a consumer had to keep in step by hand, and any one of them forgotten showed
  as a table that never stops spinning or never reports a failure. One binding now carries all
  three: the value is read exactly as `[data]` is (an array becomes rows, a `PaginationState`
  becomes rows plus page, size and total), `isLoading()` drives the loading state and `error()`
  the error state. Typed by shape rather than as `ResourceRef`, which landed in Angular 19 while
  this package supports 18 — see `HubPaginableResource`. Bound alongside `[data]` / `[items]` the
  resource wins, and paging deliberately does **not** call `reload()`: whoever owns the request
  keeps owning it. A failure is read before the value and the value only when there is none,
  because a resource in the error state has nothing to hand over and says so by rethrowing from
  `value()`; the rows of the last good load stay where they are behind the error state, so a
  refresh that fails does not cost the reader the table they were looking at.

- **`selectWhileSelecting` makes a row click mark the row while a selection is under way.**
  Picking several rows with a finger means tapping them, and on a table whose rows open a record
  the second tap navigated away with the selection built up so far. The input is off by default —
  on a pointer a click keeps the meaning the consumer gave it, and switching everybody over would
  break the readers who navigate while they pick. It carries no state of its own: the mode is on
  while at least one row is selected, so it is entered by ticking the first box and left by
  unticking the last one. Enter and Space on a focused row follow the same rule.

- **`<hub-ui-paginator>` is a name the paginator answers to.** The `hub-ui-` spelling was on the
  table, the list and the dropdown but not on the paginator, so a template that reached for it
  matched nothing and rendered an empty element — and this repository's own CSS reference has been
  teaching that spelling for as long as it has been wrong. `hub-paginator` and
  `paginable-table-paginator` are untouched. Purely additive, and it is the only alias added: the
  alias exists to answer a spelling the documentation already teaches, and nothing teaches one for
  the four element names left. `hub-menu-filter` is not exported at all and `hub-state-outlet` is
  exported for its types while the README documents it as an internal outlet; `hub-table-dropdown`
  is the legacy row-actions surface being replaced; `hub-table-range-input` is documented under
  that one name and only inside a custom filter template. `hub-icon` is left alone for a different
  reason — it duplicates the component of the same name in `ng-hub-ui-icons`, so a third spelling
  would spread a collision rather than settle it.

- **The list, the column filter panel and the row-actions menu publish icon variables of their
  own.** All three drew their glyphs with the table's — `--hub-table-icon-chevron-down` on the
  list's collapse trigger, `--trash` and `--plus` in the filter panel, `--ellipsis-v` on the menu —
  so a product that wanted another chevron in the list had to redefine a variable named after the
  table, and got the table changed along with it. Each component now declares its own family and
  names its own classes: `--hub-list-icon-*` with `.hub-list__icon--*`, `--hub-filter-icon-*` with
  `.hub-filter__icon--*` and `--hub-table-dropdown-icon-*` with `.hub-table-dropdown__icon--*`.
  Every default is the glyph that was already there. The list's magnifier had no variable at all —
  the SVG sat inside `mask-image` in the stylesheet — and is `--hub-list-icon-search` now.

### Changed

- **The filter panel, the dropdown and the legacy row-actions menu answer to names this
  library owns.** `.filter__*` became `hub-filter__*`, `.dropdown__*` became `hub-dropdown__*`
  and `.table-dropdown__*` became `hub-table-dropdown__*`, in line with the `hub-table__*` /
  `hub-list__*` / `.hub-paginator` blocks migrated before them. The internal `<menu-filter>`
  element is `<hub-menu-filter>` for the same reason: an un-prefixed element name is a global
  name, and this one was never exported for a consumer to use. See `BREAKING_CHANGES.md`.

- **Every remaining `@Input()` is a signal input, and the host bindings live in the metadata.**
  `ListComponent.items` / `options` / `batchActions`, `MenuFilterComponent.header`,
  `HubIconComponent.config` and `PaginableTableDropdownComponent.options` were accessor inputs
  whose setters wrote sibling fields, so those fields were only ever right in the order the
  setters happened to run. They are inputs with a transform now, and what used to be written by
  hand — `matchModes`, `defaultValue`, `buttonClass`, `toggleColor`, the icon's `type` / `value` /
  `variant` / `classlist` / `content` — is derived. Reading any of them from code means calling
  it: see `BREAKING_CHANGES.md`. Template bindings are unchanged.

- **`searchFn` and `compareFn` do what the table has been publishing them as.** Both were declared
  inputs the component never read — binding either changed nothing, and `compareFn` carried a
  `TODO: Implementar` in the source. `searchFn` now decides whether a row survives the global
  search in client mode, and `compareFn` decides when two selection values are the same record.
  **`searchFn` changes shape to do it**: `(a: T, b: T) => boolean` could not drive a search because
  it never received a term, so it is now `(item: T, term: string) => boolean` — the same contract
  `hub-list` already honours, term included already trimmed and lowercased. That is a break for
  anyone who typed the old signature by hand; see `BREAKING_CHANGES.md`. Neither input changes
  anything while unbound: without `searchFn` the search still scans every searchable column, and
  without `compareFn` the selection is still matched exactly as before, JSON serialization in
  `markSelected` and reference equality in the toggles.

- **Every component declares `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` instead of leaving it to the
  compiler.** This buys nothing on Angular 22, where an omitted strategy already compiles to
  OnPush, so no consumer on the version this release targets gains any speed from it. It matters
  one version down: this package supports Angular from 18, and a linker older than 22 reading a
  partial declaration with no `changeDetection` falls back to the eager strategy. Declaring it puts
  those consumers on the same strategy the components are actually written and tested for.

### Removed

- **The paragraph the table printed into the console when no actions adapter was registered.** It
  was emitted in production builds and deliberately not in development ones, which put an
  `npm i ng-hub-ui-buttons` and two lines of provider setup in front of the end user of the
  consuming application — on a page they cannot change, about a decision they did not take, and with
  no way to switch it off. The deprecation itself stands untouched: it is on
  `PaginableTableDropdownComponent`'s `@deprecated` tag, in the READMEs and in the 22.16.0 entry of
  this file, which is where a message addressed to a developer belongs.
  `table-console-silence.spec.ts` holds both the fallback rendering and the deprecated dropdown to
  silence.

### Deprecated

- **`HubUITableModule` (and its `TableModule` alias).** The module declares and exports nothing —
  the commented-out body it still carries is from before the components went standalone — so all it
  does today is carry providers through `forRoot()`. `providePaginable()` does that in one line and
  works in a route's providers as well as at bootstrap. The class is marked `@deprecated` and
  **behaves exactly as before**; it is removed in `23.0.0`, the release that moves this family to
  Angular 23. See `BREAKING_CHANGES.md`.

    The tag sits above `@NgModule(…)`, which is where it has to sit to exist at all: a decorated
    class begins at its decorator, so a JSDoc block written between the decorator and `export class`
    falls inside the declaration and TypeScript attaches nothing — no strike-through in the editor,
    no warning from a build that fails on deprecations, a notice visible only to whoever opens the
    file. `PaginableTableDropdownComponent`, deprecated back in 22.16.0, had been carrying its tag
    in exactly that dead spot ever since; it is moved too. `library-module-deprecations.spec.ts`
    asks the compiler rather than the text, so the placement cannot rot back.

### Fixed

- **The README no longer opens by teaching a module that renders nothing.** Its first snippet —
  the one a reader copies — put `HubUITableModule` in a standalone component's `imports` and then
  wrote `<hub-ui-table>` in the template. The module declares and exports no component, so that
  element resolves to nothing: the very first thing the documentation asked anybody to do could
  not work. Both READMEs import `TableComponent`, and the troubleshooting section says plainly
  what the module does and does not do.

- **Missing the row checkbox by a few pixels no longer opens the row.** Only the `<input>` stopped
  the click from reaching the row, and a native checkbox is a fraction of the cell it sits in, so a
  pointer landing anywhere else in that cell ran the consumer's `clickFn` instead. That commonly
  navigates, which took the selection built up so far with it. The whole selection cell now stops
  the click and the control fills it, so there is no near-miss left to catch.

- **The package declares a `styles` entry point, so the theming mixins can be reached the way
  the README says they can.** `package.json` carried no `exports` map at all, which left the
  `styles/` folder ng-packagr copies into the distribution undeclared: the only thing a
  consumer could import by name was the JavaScript entry. `ng-hub-ui-paginable/styles` now
  forwards `hub-table-theme` and `hub-list-theme` from one place, and each partial keeps its
  own subpath. Component structure still ships compiled with each component — there was never
  a global sheet to import, which is why the old instruction could not have worked.
- **The filter panel, the dropdown and the row menus draw themselves, in a product with
  Bootstrap or without it.** They named their appearance after Bootstrap — `.btn`,
  `.dropdown-menu`, `.dropdown-item`, `.dropdown-toggle`, `.form-control`, `.form-select` —
  and so did three controls the table and the list draw themselves. That failed in both
  directions at once: without Bootstrap the names resolved to nothing, so the column filter
  came out as bare text on a transparent box and the row-expander caret fell back to the
  browser's grey button; with Bootstrap the host application's stylesheet owned the appearance
  of the library's own internals, and a theme change there reshaped them unasked. Each surface
  now ships the rules it used to borrow, drawn from the system tokens.

- **The paginator speaks the language it was configured in.** Its first, previous, next and
  last controls are icon-only, so the `aria-label` is the entire accessible name a screen
  reader gets — and in nine of the eleven shipped languages that name fell through to English,
  because only `en` and `es` ever defined `PAGINATION`, `FIRST`, `PREVIOUS`, `NEXT` and `LAST`
  and every other dictionary spreads the English one. Someone browsing in Catalan or German
  heard "First", "Previous", "Next" announced with no marked language change. The nine
  dictionaries (`an`, `ar`, `ast`, `ca`, `de`, `eu`, `gl`, `ru`, `zh`) now carry their own
  wording.

- **The styling section of the README no longer sends readers to a file that never existed.**
  It told them to `@use 'ng-hub-ui-paginable/src/lib/styles/paginable.scss'` — a `paginable.scss`
  that is nowhere in the repository, under a `src/lib/` layout the published package does not
  have — while a later section of the same document taught the real shape. Both READMEs now
  document the entry point the package actually declares. The CSS variables reference they link
  to is also shipped in the distribution now, so that link resolves for anyone reading the
  README on npm rather than on GitHub.

- **`paginationInfo` actually hides the "showing X of Y" line.** The input existed, read the
  app-wide default from `providePaginable({ defaults })` and typed itself `boolean`, but the
  template never asked for it: the line was guarded only by whether the table knew a total.
  Setting it to `false` — per instance or app-wide — changed nothing, and the only test on it
  checked the signal read back rather than the rendered output. Consumers were hiding the line
  with CSS on `.hub-table__bottom-bar-info` because the documented switch did not respond.

- **`paginationPosition` puts the pagination bar where it says it does.** The input typed itself
  `'bottom' | 'top' | 'both'` and the READMEs, the functionality table and the playground all
  described the three values as placements, but the template drew one bar under the rows and asked
  the input only whether to put a paginator inside it. `top` therefore deleted the paginator
  instead of moving it, and `both` was indistinguishable from `bottom`. The bar is one template
  now — paginator, page-size selector and row count together, since moving only the paginator
  would leave the rest behind — drawn above the rows for `top`, under them for `bottom` and in
  both places for `both`. Each one carries `hub-table__bottom-bar--top` or
  `hub-table__bottom-bar--bottom` so a consumer can address one of the two. No signature changes,
  and `bottom` renders exactly what it did before.

- **Opening a `hub-dropdown` no longer writes to the browser console.** A debug
  `console.warn` left in `openDropdown()` reported a state the component's required view query
  cannot even reach, so the only thing it could ever do was add noise to a consumer's console.

- **A `hub-dropdown` carries on the host the identifier it was given, not a stringified signal.**
  The id reached the element through a bare `@HostBinding()` on a field holding an `input()`, and
  nothing unwraps a signal in a host binding, so the rendered attribute read
  `[Input Signal: …]`. The table tells one open menu from another by that id, and anybody
  labelling a menu from outside — `aria-controls`, a test selector, a stylesheet — was pointing at
  a name the DOM never had.

- **The documentation names selectors, inputs and template contexts that exist.** Both READMEs
  taught `<hub-ui-paginator>` and `<hub-ui-icon>`, which the library never declared, and projected
  into `notFoundTpt`, `tableRow` and `listItem`, which no directive matches — so a reader who
  copied any of them got the default rendering and no error. The cell examples read
  `let-data="data"` out of a context whose keys are `header`, `item`, `row` and `property`, the
  row example read the record straight off a `TableRow` wrapper, and the documentation page taught
  a `*paginableTableCell="let value; let row"` microsyntax that binds neither. The input tables
  were missing eight table inputs, sixteen list inputs and the paginator's `rtl`, and gave the
  wrong type and default for `selectable`. `table-docs.spec.ts` now reads the library's own
  sources and fails when any of that drifts again.

- **The Spanish README documents the same API as the English one, and both testing snippets query
  markup the components render.** `README.es.md` still described `PaginableTableDropdown` as
  `{ title: string; buttons; fill?: string; position?: 'start' | 'end'; color? }` — `title` is
  optional and takes an `Observable`, and `icon`, `tooltip`, `hidden` and `disabled` were missing
  outright — and never mentioned `PaginableActionButton`, its `variant` / `color` vocabulary or
  the reactive-translation contract, so a reader working in Spanish configured a row menu against
  an interface the library stopped having. In `README.md` the edit action declared `tooltip` twice
  in one object literal, which TypeScript refuses to compile; the migration guide imported
  `provideTableConfig`, a name the package has never exported — it is `providePaginable` — and the
  testing guide reached for `input[type="search"]` and `.pagination .page-item … button`: the
  search field is `.hub-table__search-input` and the paginator controls are `<a role="button">`
  inside `.hub-paginator__item`, so both queries found nothing. `ListClickEvent` was quoted
  without `children`, the member that carries a group's items. `table-docs.spec.ts` now holds
  every quoted interface and every `import … from 'ng-hub-ui-paginable'` against the sources.

- **The documentation page's release history is complete and says only what was released.** It ran
  from the current version down to 19.10.2 while dropping twenty-three releases on the way — the
  whole 21.x line among them — and the 19.10.2 entry it did print announced an `added` and a
  `changed` for a release whose only section is `Fixed`. `table-changelog.spec.ts` now holds every
  announced version against this file: same date, no kind of change the release did not contain,
  and no gap above the floor the page declares.

- **The glyphs of the list, the filter panel and the row-actions menu are drawn at all.** They
  asked for `hub-table__icon`, and a component stylesheet is scoped to that component's own view:
  the class reached the table and nothing else. So the trigger that folds a group of list items was
  an empty box, the loading, error and no-results messages had no symbol in front of them, the
  filter panel's add and remove rules were bare words, and the row-actions menu had no three dots
  to click — only a button-sized gap where they should have been. Each of them now uses its own
  class, which its own stylesheet ships.

- **The chevron marking a collapsed item is the mirror of the one marking an expanded item.**
  `--hub-table-icon-chevron-down` was `-up` reflected in nine of its ten segments; in the tenth a
  control point had lost a minus sign and sat on the wrong side of the curve, so one arm of the
  glyph opened wider than the other. Nine of the ten had been checked by eye, which is how it
  survived. `table-icon-symmetry.spec.ts` now walks each arrow pair into points and reflects one
  onto the other, so the next dropped sign fails a test instead of shipping.

- **The last-page button's double chevron is drawn right.** The same check found a second one:
  `--hub-paginator-icon-angle-double-right`, and the table's unused copy of it, had every vertical
  offset negated in the closing curve of its second chevron, which pulled that chevron's lower arm
  upwards into a hook. It is on every paginated table and list, which is where a broken arrow is
  least likely to be looked at twice.

- **The token catalogue stops promising eight table glyph variables that theme nothing.**
  `--hub-table-icon-chevron-up`, `-down`, `-left`, `-right`, `-angle-left`, `-angle-right`,
  `-angle-double-left` and `-angle-double-right` are listed as themable, and each is consumed by a
  `.hub-table__icon--*` rule — but no template in the package paints those classes, and the rules
  are scoped to the table's own view, so a consumer cannot reach them either. Overriding any of the
  eight changes nothing on screen, and both catalogues now say so. The variables are left in place:
  removing published API is a decision for a release, not for a documentation pass.

## [22.17.0] - 2026-09-02

### Fixed

- **The column-filter row is visible again**, so a column that offers a filter looks
  different from one that does not.

    The inline filter controls were dressed in `.form-control` / `.form-select`, and the
    clear-filters button in `.btn.btn-outline-danger` — Bootstrap's names, which resolve to
    nothing in a product that does not ship Bootstrap. Measured in one: the row under the
    header rendered as bare text on the header surface, a numeric range showed the words
    "from" and "to" floating with no field around them, and the clear button fell back to
    the browser's native chrome, a different height and shape from the search field it
    stands beside. The documentation site never showed it because the site itself ships
    Bootstrap.

    The row is now drawn from this table's own tokens, exactly as the search field beside
    it already was — same story, same fix as the row actions in 22.16.0.

- **The filter row draws its controls on the first render.** They are built from
  `filtersFG`, and `FormGroup.addControl` is invisible to change detection: the cells were
  drawn before the controls existed, asked the group once, got `null`, and kept the empty
  answer until some unrelated event happened to redraw the table. A table that was merely
  looked at — the case in the documentation site — showed a filter row with nothing in it.
  The set of controls is now published as a signal, so a cell appears when its control
  does. The rebuild also moved out of a `setTimeout` fired from inside a memoised
  `computed` and into an effect of its own.

- **The mirrored (RTL) search group draws its outer edge.** The button dropped its
  inline-start border to avoid doubling the hairline it shares with the field — correct
  while it trails the field, but in RTL it leads, so the group was open on its left edge.
  It now drops whichever edge it actually shares.

### Added

- **A clear affordance in the search box.** While the box holds a term, an × appears
  between the field and the magnifier and empties it in one click — both the term and the
  keystroke still sitting in the debounce window, so nothing re-applies a moment later.
  It is a segment of the search group rather than a glyph floating over the field, because
  with `provideHubPaginableFormControls` the field is a component created at runtime that
  no rule in this table can reach. Themed through `--hub-table-search-clear-*` and labelled
  by the new `CLEAR_SEARCH` key, translated in all eleven shipped languages.

- **A filter that holds a value says so.** The filter cell takes
  `hub-table__filter-cell--active` while its control is set, tinting the field in the
  same green the menu-filter trigger already uses. The row now answers both questions at
  a glance: which columns can be filtered, and which of them currently are. An emptied
  range (`[null, null]`) reads as inactive, so clearing a filter clears its state too.

- **`--hub-table-filter-row-bg`, `--hub-table-filter-cell-padding-x` / `-y` and the
  `--hub-table-filter-control-*` family** (background, colour, placeholder colour,
  border, radius, padding, font size, focus ring and the two `-active-*` slots) — the
  filter row's surface and the fields on it. The range control reads the same family, so
  a two-ended range and a plain text filter are the same field in the same row.

- **`--hub-table-delete-filters-*`** — background, colour, border, radius, padding, font
  size, gap, the three `-hover-*` slots and `-disabled-opacity` for the clear-filters
  button. It defaults to the toolbar chrome of the search button next to it and turns
  destructive only under the cursor, where the intent is already declared.

- **`--hub-table-search-clear-*`** (colour, hover colour, icon size, padding) and
  **`--hub-table-icon-close`**, the glyph the clear affordance wears — replaceable like
  every other icon in this table.

## [22.16.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- **`provideHubPaginableActions`**, so the table's row buttons and menus are drawn by a
  real component library instead of by the table itself.

    What the table drew was markup in Bootstrap class names — `.btn`, `.dropdown-menu`,
    `.dropdown-item` — which resolve to nothing in a product that does not ship Bootstrap.
    Measured in one: the menu trigger fell back to the browser's default grey button
    (`2px outset`, square, the wrong height beside its neighbours) and the panel was a
    transparent box with no border, no shadow and no padding. The row actions had been
    given the design system's vocabulary; the menu was left behind wearing names that no
    longer resolve.

    Rather than restyle a second implementation of a dropdown the button library already
    has — with placement, outside-click, Escape, scroll and focus already solved — the
    table now _describes_ what a row offers and an adapter draws it. Exactly the
    arrangement `provideHubPaginableFormControls` already uses for the table's inputs, and
    with the same consequence: **no new dependency**, in either direction.

    ```ts
    import { provideHubPaginableActions } from 'ng-hub-ui-paginable';
    import { hubActionsAdapter } from 'ng-hub-ui-buttons';

    providers: [provideHubPaginableActions(hubActionsAdapter)];
    ```

    Nothing changes in how actions are declared: `variant`, `color`, `icon`, `hidden`,
    `disabled` and `tooltip` stay the API, and a table already in use needs no edit to a
    single header. What the adapter receives is fully resolved for the row — hidden actions
    are absent, predicates are booleans, Observable labels are strings — so an adapter never
    has to know any of that is possible.

- **`hidden` and `disabled` on `PaginableTableDropdown`**, so a menu can be refused on a
  row like any other action.

### Deprecated

- **`PaginableTableDropdownComponent`**, and the built-in markup the table falls back to
  when no adapter is registered. Both still work and nothing breaks by upgrading; the
  table says so once per application, in production builds, naming the one line that
  fixes it.

### Fixed

- **A dropdown item now answers `hidden` and `disabled` like any other row action.**

    An action tucked into the ⋮ menu is the same action, and it answered to nothing. The
    menu read `hidden` as a plain boolean, so the predicate form — the one every button
    drawn directly in the cell accepts — was a function, and a function is always truthy:
    an action meant to disappear on _some_ rows disappeared from _every_ row. `disabled`
    was ignored outright, with no effect whatsoever.

    That is what pushed consumers to keep row-dependent actions out of the menu, which is
    precisely the crowding the menu exists to relieve: an action column with five buttons
    had no way to fold two of them away if either depended on the row.

    Both flags now take a boolean or a predicate over the row, resolved through the same
    path the cell's buttons use, and the refusal is enforced in the handler as well — the
    menu closes on click, so the `disabled` attribute alone would not stop it. A disabled
    item is drawn with the table's own formula and token
    (`--hub-table-action-disabled-opacity`), so it reads as refused in the menu exactly as
    it does in the cell.

## [22.15.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- **`disabled` on a row action** (`PaginableActionButton.disabled`), boolean or predicate,
  shaped exactly like `hidden` because both answer the same question about the same button.

    `hidden` was the only thing a consumer could say about an action that does not apply, and
    it says the wrong thing for half the cases: a cancelled payment is not a row where editing
    does not exist, it is a row where editing has nothing left to act on. Forced to choose,
    consumers hid the action — so the column changed shape row by row and nothing on screen
    said why the button was gone.

    It reaches the rendered `<button>`, so the browser refuses the click and announces the
    state, and the tooltip still shows — which is where the reason belongs. A refused action
    also **looks** refused now: this table draws its own buttons, so the browser's default
    disabled rendering never reached them, and without a rule a `disabled` action would have
    kept its full tint and its pointer while swallowing every click. Tunable through
    `--hub-table-action-disabled-opacity`.

## [22.14.1] - 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- **The search field's geometry actually reaches it now.** 22.14.0 claimed this and shipped it inert. The rule was written as `::ng-deep`, and nested by accident inside the component's right-to-left block, so it compiled to `:host.hub-table--rtl :host ::ng-deep …` — confined to a direction most tables are not in, and unmatchable even there, because `:host` twice describes an element inside itself. It read correctly in the source and applied in no table anywhere.

    It is not a `::ng-deep` rule any more, and that is the actual repair rather than a correction of the selector. Reaching into a component this table does not own was the wrong shape to begin with: custom properties inherit, so the container states the group's radius on its **own** element and whatever fills it reads it — the adapter's `<hub-input>`, or the native fallback, which ignores what it does not use. Nothing names the control.

    Measured on a consuming application: field and button both 38px where the button was 54px, trailing corners flattened, and no rule in the whole document naming the control. Two cases pin it — the container declares the radius, and no shipped selector mentions `ng-deep` or the control.

    The other half of what made the button overshoot — a form field's stacking margin, kept by a control that is not stacked in a form — moved to `ng-hub-ui-forms`, where the adapter that creates it says so once for every library that wires it.

## [22.14.0] - 2026-08-21

### Changed

- **A row action's colour is resolved, not enumerated.** `PaginableActionButton.color` is typed `… | (string & {})` and accepts any string on purpose, but the accent arrived as a class the stylesheet matched against seven built-in names. Anything else — a role a consumer declared, a literal `#ff6600` — produced a class matching no rule, an unset custom property and a `color-mix` with nothing to mix: a button with no accent, no error and no warning, from an API whose type said any string was welcome.

    The accent is a value now, written on the element through `resolveHubAccent` — the same helper this component already used for its own variant, and the list for hers. A bare word becomes `var(--hub-sys-color-<word>, <word>)` so both the system's roles and a consumer's own resolve; anything already a colour passes through untouched. The seven rules are gone, and the bench now pins that the stylesheet names no colours at all.

### Added

- **`variant` and `color` on a row action, so it can look like the buttons beside it.** The table draws these buttons itself — plain `<button>` elements — and `hub-buttons` styles appearance through `:host(...)`, which matches nothing on an element the primitive did not create. A consumer who wanted a tinted row action therefore rebuilt the tint in its own stylesheet: two copies of one formula, free to drift the moment either side changed.

    The vocabulary is `hubButton`'s (`solid`, `soft`, `outline`, `ghost`, plus the `default` this table has always drawn) and the tints ship here, built with the primitive's own arithmetic — the accent at 12% over the page surface for the subtle, at 80% over the ink for the emphasis — so the two read the same side by side. `default` stays the default and takes no colour: colouring it would be giving it a variant by the back door. A variant with no colour is `neutral`, not colourless.

### Fixed

- **The table's chrome controls survive being rendered through the hub-forms adapter.** `provideHubPaginableFormControls` swaps the search box and the page-size picker for `<hub-input>` and `<hub-select>`, and the CSS for them was written for the native fallbacks. The two encapsulation modes then failed in opposite directions: the table's stylesheet is **emulated**, so its `.hub-table__search-input` rule carried an `_ngcontent` attribute and never reached a dynamically created component — the field came out with none of the group geometry, a standalone rounded control beside the button it was meant to be joined to; the paginator's ships with **`encapsulation: None`**, so its `.hub-paginator__select` rule _did_ reach the component's host and drew a second border and padding around a control that already draws its own. One rule too narrow, one too wide, from the same assumption. The native skin now names the native element, the adapter's host draws no box, and the search field is reached through `::ng-deep` scoped to the table's host.

- **The search button declares its own border.** It set a border _colour_ and no width or style, which draws nothing unless something else supplies them — Bootstrap's `.btn`, which this family does not ship. Without it, the browser's own button chrome showed beside the search field.

- **The sort trigger stops borrowing chrome the host may not have.** `<hub-table>` draws its own sort button and styled only the glyph inside it, leaving the `<button>` to whatever the application provided — and it carried a bare `btn`, which is Bootstrap's and which this family neither ships nor depends on. In an application without Bootstrap the class matched nothing and every sortable column header showed the browser's native grey button around the glyph. The class is gone from the markup and the component now styles its own trigger: no box, no background, no padding, the header cell's own colour, and `--hub-table-sort-btn-hover-color` for the hover.

### Changed

- **Rebuilding `items` no longer prunes the selection, and no longer publishes.** The setter used to recompute the value from whatever survived the rebuild and, if it differed, announce it through the CVA. It reads as tidy and it is a guess: `items` shrinking means "those are gone" on a filtered catalogue and "this is page two" on a paged one, and the component sees the same thing in both cases — only the consumer, who did the paging, can tell. So a list that merely turned a page told its consumer the user had removed a selection they never touched, with no way to distinguish that from a real removal. The written value is now kept whole and only the part that is on offer is ticked. Angular's own `<select>` takes the same position: an option disappearing does not clear the model.

    **This is a behaviour change.** A consumer that relied on the list pruning its own value has to prune it itself, where it knows why the offer changed.

## [22.13.0] - 2026-08-18

### Added

- **`flushFields` on `hub-table`: the controls in the cells drawn as a spreadsheet, not as a form.** A field is boxed so it can be told apart from the page around it. A table cell already does that job — it has its own grid — so the box gets drawn twice, and an editable table ends up reading as a form that fell into a table.

    With it: the fields lose their border and surface, a static `prepend`/`append` reads as the plain text or icon it is rather than as a chip, and a projected button stops being welded to its neighbour — it gets its corners back, a gap, and its own border colour, because two actions in a cell are two things to press rather than one strip. The control's own shared corners come back too: nothing here is joined to anything, so nothing should show the flat side that says it is.

    Implemented as a token assignment on the cells rather than as an input on each field, which is why it reaches a consumer's own `cellTpt` content as well. It needs `ng-hub-ui-forms@22.21.0` for the seam tokens; on an older version the fields still go flat and the attached strip simply stays welded.

    One detail worth knowing before reaching for it: `hub-select` declares its own `--hub-select-border-width` and `--hub-select-bg`, so the bundle restates the select's twins — set only the shared pair and you get boxed selects among flat inputs.

## [22.12.3] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- **`flush` keeps the padding, in the list and in the table.** The variant zeroed `--hub-list-item-padding-x` — and `--hub-table-cell-padding-x` — along with the border, the radius and the surface. In a list that left the checkbox or radio hard against one edge and the trailing figure against the other; in a table it ran the columns into each other, which costs a table the one thing it is for. It was also incoherent with itself: the vertical padding stayed, so a flush collection had breathing room on one axis and none on the other.

    Flush answers to Bootstrap's `.list-group-flush`, which drops the side borders and the radius and **keeps** the padding — taking off the chrome is not the same as taking off the space to read in. A consumer who really does want the text bleeding to the edge sets `--hub-list-item-padding-x: 0` from outside, which is what the token is for.

## [22.12.2] - 2026-08-18

### Removed

- **An XML namespace that was declared and never used.** The table's loading spinner carried `xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"` on its inline `<svg>`, and `xlink:href` appears nowhere in this monorepo — the attribute had been dead since it was written.

    Worth a line because of how it surfaced: a supply-chain scanner reports the package as containing "fragments of URLs or external IP addresses, which the package may be accessing at runtime", and this was one of them. It was never an address — a namespace URI names a vocabulary and is never dereferenced — but one of the two it found turned out to be genuinely dead, so it goes.

    The other one stays: `http://www.w3.org/2000/svg` survives around fifty times, from the table's own icons, which are `data:image/svg+xml` URLs in SCSS. A `data:` URI is parsed as XML rather than as HTML, so the namespace declaration is what makes the icon render at all. The reasoning, and the decision to accept the alert rather than break the icons for it, is written down in `socket.yml` at the workspace root.

## [22.12.1] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed

- **A group row gets no radio in single selection.** The control was drawn on every row, so in a list grouped with `bindChildren` a heading became one of the things to choose — picking "Edificio Triana" answered with a building, which nobody can book. Only leaves carry a radio now, which is the single-selection twin of the cascade 22.12.0 gave `multiple`. It was the last thing standing between a grouped single-choice list and the primitive: a consumer needing one had to draw the control itself.

## [22.12.0] - 2026-08-17

### Changed

- **BREAKING — `clickFn` hands over the item, not the internal wrapper.** `ListClickEvent.item` carried the form group wrapping each row — `{selected, collapsed, data, children}` — while the published type said `item: T`. A consumer reading `event.item.<field>` by the types got `undefined`: no error, no warning, every guard silently false. It is the item now. `value` reads `bindLabel` from the item rather than from the wrapper (it was almost always `undefined` before), and a new `children: T[]` hands over a group's children as items. See `BREAKING_CHANGES.md`.

- **BREAKING — a group row selects its children instead of itself.** With `bindChildren`, a group's checkbox put the group's own value into the selection and left its children alone, so ticking a building meant "the building", which nobody can book, and a building with one room chosen looked exactly like one with none. Ticking a group now takes everything under it, a partly-selected group renders `indeterminate`, and only leaves travel in the value.

### Fixed

- **Rebuilding `items` no longer clears the selection, nor claims the user did.** The setter emptied the form and published the empty selection through the CVA, so a list that merely re-read its data dropped the choice _and_ told the consumer the user had cleared it — with no way to tell a refresh from an edit. The selection is carried across the rebuild and matched by `bindValue`; only what the new items no longer offer falls out of it; and nothing is published unless something really went.

- **`setDisabledState` disables.** It assigned a flag the template never read, so a disabled list still changed its selection. The flag now disables the form — reaching every `selected` control, however deep — and the selection is left alone even when something drives it programmatically. Through the form and not a `[disabled]` binding, because Angular ignores that binding on a reactive control: it warns and the box stays live.

- **`options.searchable` searches.** The component rendered a search box wired to a `filter()` whose body was entirely commented out: a control the API offered and the component ignored. It filters now, with a `searchTerm` model and an optional `searchFn` — the same two names `hub-table` uses, so the components do not disagree about what "searchable" means. A group survives while any descendant matches, because hiding a building for not being named "Timple" would hide the Timple room inside it. Submitting returns to the first page: staying on page four of a list that just became three rows long shows an empty list, which reads as "nothing matched".

## [22.11.0] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- **`flush` on `hub-list` and `hub-table`: the collection drawn as a list rather than as a stack of cards.** Every row wears its own border, radius and surface by default. That is right for a collection standing on a page and wrong for a list of choices inside a dialog or a panel, where a bordered box per row reads as a region of its own rather than as one list to pick from — and where the surface has already drawn the frame.

    It had to be an input rather than something a consumer reaches with CSS, and the reason is worth writing down because it is a trap the whole token catalogue shares: `hub-list` declares its defaults on `:root, :host`, and the host is the very element a consumer puts a class on. Their assignment therefore ties on specificity and loses on source order — silently, with no error and no warning, which reads as "the token does nothing". The variant is declared on `:host(.hub-list--flush)`, where it out-weighs what it overrides, and `flush` binds the class.

    Two tokens come with it, read only under the variant: `--hub-list-divider-width` and `--hub-list-divider-color`, the rule that stands in for the gap. It falls between siblings only, so the list neither opens nor closes with one; a group and the collection it opens keep none between them; and the cards display gets none at all, because a grid separated by rules would draw them across the gaps.

    `hub-table` takes the same input, zeroing the outer border, the radius, the head rule and the cell padding. Its **row divider survives on purpose** — a table with no line between rows stops being readable across its columns, which is the one thing a table is for.

- **`hub-list-flush` as a mixin too**, in `styles/mixins/_list-theme.scss`, beside `hub-list-theme`. The input covers the common case with no stylesheet at all; the mixin is for the other one — applying the shape from your own selector, to every list in a region, without touching templates. The component includes that same mixin under `:host(.hub-list--flush)`, so the two cannot drift apart.

### Fixed

- **The package's stylesheets ship where the documentation says they do.** `ng-package.json` copied `src/lib/styles` with the short `assets` form, which **preserves the source path**, so the theming mixins landed at `ng-hub-ui-paginable/src/lib/styles/mixins/…` while their own docblocks told consumers to `@use 'ng-hub-ui-paginable/styles/mixins/list-theme'`. That path never resolved — `hub-list-theme` has been documented at an address it was not published to since it shipped. Now the long form with `output: "styles"`, which is what `utils` and `forms` already use.

- **The single-selection radio has a rule.** It shipped with the mode in 22.10.0 and had no CSS at all: `.hub-list__radio` matched nothing in the component, so the control rendered at the browser's own size beside a themed list, visibly not part of it. It now takes `--hub-list-radio-size` — defaulting to the checkbox's, since the two are the same control wearing a different rule about how many may be on — and the list's accent.

## [22.10.0] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- **`hub-list` single selection actually selects.** `selectable` has enumerated `single` since it shipped — its own transform even turns a bare `true` into it — and then nothing read the value. In the whole template `selectable()` was read once, to add a pointer cursor; the checkbox that mutates the selection was gated on `multiple`, and the row's click handler never touched it. So a consumer writing `selectable="single"` got a cursor and silence: an API typed, enumerated and inert.

    It is not an edge case — "choose one of these" is the ordinary shape for a room, a plan or a payment method — and every consumer that needed it built the row control by hand on top of an API that looked like it already did the job.

    Single now renders a radio per row, grouped per list instance so two lists on one page cannot fight over one selection, and picking a row releases the previous one across the whole tree rather than the visible page.

    **The value is the value, not a list of one.** Single emits the bare value (or `null`), and accepts one, exactly as `hub-select` does — asking "which one" should never mean reading `[0]` and then telling an empty array apart from a missing answer. `multiple` is untouched and still emits an array.

### Fixed

- **A value written by the form repainted nothing in single mode.** `writeValue` runs outside the component's own change detection, and the radio is a plain `[checked]` binding rather than a `formControlName` — which writes to the DOM itself and so never needed marking. Patching the control from the consumer's form moved the selection internally and left the rendered choice behind.

## [22.9.0] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- **`provideHubTableTooltip`, to give the table's own controls a themed tooltip.** Row actions and dropdown entries are drawn by the table from the `headers` configuration, so a consumer cannot reach them to restyle anything — their labels were stuck on the browser's native `title`, which ignores every theme and appears where the browser decides.

    Registering an adapter routes those labels to whatever tooltip the application already uses. Without one, the native `title` stays exactly as before: the table has no business requiring `ng-hub-ui-utils/styles/tooltip` in an application that never asked for it, and a themed tooltip missing its stylesheet is worse than the native one it replaced.

    ```ts
    provideHubTableTooltip({
    	attach: (host, text) => {
    		const controller = new HubTooltipController(host);
    		controller.setText(text);
    		return { update: (next) => controller.setText(next), destroy: () => controller.destroy() };
    	}
    });
    ```

### Fixed

- **Icon-only row actions had no accessible name.** `title` was quietly serving as it. Moving the label to a tooltip and stopping there would have left a screen reader with an unlabelled button, so the text is now mirrored to `aria-label` — but only where the control renders no text of its own. Where a visible label exists it _is_ the name, and overriding it with different words breaks WCAG 2.5.3 (Label in Name) in the belief of improving it.

## [22.8.1] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed

- **Row-action icons sat low in their buttons.** The button took its height from the line box of the glyph inside it, and an icon font's glyph is an inline-block resting on the baseline — so a 16px glyph in a 24px line box hung from that baseline and left the descender gap underneath. Measured on a 28px button: 4px of air above, 8px below.

    The content row now carries an explicit height and centres the glyph inside it, which keeps the button at 28px and splits the gap evenly. Measured after: 28px, 6 / 6.

    Recorded because both obvious repairs make it worse, and the next reader will reach for one of them: `display: flex` on the button or on the icon host removes the very line box that sets the height, collapsing the button from 28px to 20px; and `vertical-align: middle` does not centre, it overshoots to 7.78 / 4.22.

## [22.8.0] - 2026-08-14

### Changed

- **Translation lookups now resolve `HUBUI.PAGINABLE.*` before the legacy flat keys.** The table, list and paginator provide the namespace through `HUB_TRANSLATION_PREFIX`, so an application dictionary can feed them via `provideHubTranslationAdapter()` without reserving generic top-level keys. Existing flat dictionaries keep working — the bare key is still the fallback.

### Added

- README documentation for the application-wide translation adapter (`provideHubTranslationAdapter()` from `ng-hub-ui-utils`).

### Removed

- **Removed the `@angular/animations` peer dependency** and the unused table `fadeInOut` trigger declaration. The package is deprecated upstream and the trigger was never bound in the template. Applications that installed it only for `ng-hub-ui-paginable` can drop it.

## [22.7.1] - 2026-08-08

### Fixed

- Documentation links now point at the canonical localized URLs. The README linked to `https://hubui.dev/<path>` with no locale prefix and no trailing slash, and both forms are 301-redirected, so every reader arriving from npm or GitHub landed on a redirect instead of the canonical page.

## [22.7.0] - 2026-07-29

### Added

- **`--hub-table-head-border-width`** — the header's bottom-border thickness, until now locked to the shared `--hub-table-border-width` with no independent knob. Defaults to that same shared width, so nothing moves until overridden; a Bootstrap-style thicker header is `calc(var(--hub-table-border-width) * 2)` and keeps following the base width (upstream report: a theme thickening the grid moved every cell border but left the header behind).
- **`--hub-table-head-text-transform`** (default `none`) and **`--hub-table-head-letter-spacing`** (default `normal`) on the header titles — uppercase/tracked column headers without reaching for a `th` rule.

## [22.6.1] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- **SSR: importing the package no longer crashes on the server.** `DEFAULT_LANGUAGE` read `navigator.language` at module scope, so merely importing `ng-hub-ui-paginable` under Node/SSR threw `navigator is not defined` before any component ran. The constant now guards for a missing `navigator` and falls back to `'en'`.

### Removed

- Dead `ViewsService` (internal, never exported from the public API): `getViews()` threw `'not developed'`, `delete()` was commented out, and nothing consumed it.

## [22.6.0] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- **table — `[stickyHeader]` now pins the header inside a consumer's OWN scroll container.** The built-in `.hub-table__container` always established a scroll context (`overflow: auto`), which **trapped** the sticky header: when a product wrapped `<hub-table [stickyHeader]="true">` in its own fixed-height `overflow:auto` box (the common `max-height` + `overflow:auto` pattern), scrolling that box let the whole frame — header included — scroll out of view instead of pinning. `[stickyHeader]` now **releases** the container's scroll context (new `--hub-table-container-overflow`, flipped to `visible`) so the header sticks to the nearest scrolling ancestor, whether that is the built-in frame or an external box. The `options.scrollable` + `--hub-table-container-max-block-size` internal-scroll path is unchanged.
- **table — row/cell background is re-themeable by a plain tag selector (fixes dark-mode re-theming).** The surface tokens (`--hub-table-bg` / `--hub-table-color` and the `--hub-table-container-*` pair) were declared on `:host` (specificity `0,1,0`), which out-ranked a consumer's `hub-table { --hub-table-bg: … }` tag rule (`0,0,1`): re-mapping the surface for a dark theme reached the header but left the data cells/rows **white** (illegible) unless `!important` was used. Those surface tokens are no longer declared on `:host`; instead every consumption site reads them as `var(--hub-table-bg, <default>)`, so a plain `hub-table { --hub-table-bg: var(--su-surface) }` tag rule now reaches the rows and cells with **no `!important`**, while the default (and the sticky header) always resolve to an opaque colour via the same fallback. Built-in variant (`.hub-table__<variant>`) and state class rules are unchanged.

### Added

- **table — `--hub-table-container-overflow`** (default `auto`): the scroll behaviour of the built-in container. `[stickyHeader]` sets it to `visible` (see above) so the header pins to an external scroll ancestor; a product can also override it directly.
- **table — optional selected-row accent bar.** `--hub-table-selected-bar-width` (default `0` — no visual change) and `--hub-table-selected-bar-color` (defaults to the accent) draw a solid bar on the selected row's leading edge. Combined with the `hub-table__row--selected` tint (added in 22.5.0), a product can render the master-detail "active row" look — soft tint **plus** a leading accent bar — entirely through the `--hub-table-selected-*` tokens and `[rowClass]`, with no `!important`. RTL-aware (the bar mirrors to the trailing visual edge).

## [22.5.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- **table — `[stickyHeader]` input + `--hub-table-head-position`.** Pins the header while the body scrolls, **decoupled** from the built-in scroll frame: `[stickyHeader]="true"` makes the `thead` `position: sticky; top: 0` inside **any** consumer-provided scroll container (`max-height` + `overflow: auto`), not just the `options.scrollable` frame. The position is overridable via `--hub-table-head-position` (default `sticky`) and the offset via the existing `--hub-table-head-sticky-top`. Off by default — no change unless enabled.
- **table — themeable header typography & padding.** The header surface and text colour were already themeable via `--hub-table-head-bg` / `--hub-table-head-color`; the missing chrome is now exposed in the same namespace: `--hub-table-head-font-size`, `--hub-table-head-font-weight`, `--hub-table-head-padding-x`, `--hub-table-head-padding-y` (consumed by `.hub-table__header-cell` / `.hub-table__header-title-text`). Every token defaults to an existing value (cell padding / browser `th` weight), so there is **no visual change** until one is set.

### Changed

- **table — consumer-settable selected row.** The selected-row tint (`--hub-table-selected-bg` / `--hub-table-selected-color`) now also applies to a `hub-table__row--selected` class, so a product can drive the selected look from its own state via `[rowClass]` (e.g. `[rowClass]="row => row.isSelected ? 'hub-table__row--selected' : ''"`) instead of repainting the row. The built-in selection styling is unchanged.

## [22.4.0] - 2026-07-05

### Added

- **table — themeable header, row divider and scroll / sticky-header slots.** New CSS variables expose the header surface (`--hub-table-head-bg`, `--hub-table-head-color`), the inter-row divider (`--hub-table-row-divider-color`, independent of the outer frame and vertical borders), and a fixed-height scroll body with a working sticky header (`--hub-table-container-max-block-size` — set it together with `options.scrollable` to cap the body height; `--hub-table-head-sticky-top` for a sticky offset above a toolbar). Every token defaults to an existing value, so there is **no visual change** until one is set.
- **table — every built-in icon is now an overridable SVG token.** On top of the sort and row-expander caret glyphs, the remaining hard-coded icons — `search`, `filter`, `eraser`, `info`, `chevron-up/down/left/right`, `angle-left/right`, `angle-double-left/right`, `ellipsis-v`, `trash`, `plus` — now read a `--hub-table-icon-<name>` variable (painted through `mask-image`, tinted with `currentColor`), so a product can swap any of them to match its own iconography. Consumer icons passed through `header.icon` / `button.icon` still accept any icon-font class (Font Awesome, etc.).
- **table — master-detail expanding-row template gets a `colspan`.** The `*paginableTableExpandingRow` template context now exposes `colspan` (read it with `let-colspan="colspan"`) so a detail `<tr><td [attr.colspan]="colspan">` always spans the full table width. Both the expanding row and the state rows (loading / error / no-results) now use a full-width colspan that the browser clamps to the real column count — no manual counting needed.
- **table — multiple sticky columns per side.** `sticky: 'start' | 'end'` now supports **more than one** column pinned to the same side: a new `hubStickyColumns` directive measures each pinned column's real width and applies a cumulative offset, so sticky columns stack side by side instead of collapsing onto `left: 0` / `right: 0`. It re-syncs on viewport / column resize (`ResizeObserver`) and row / column changes (`MutationObserver`), and is SSR-safe (a no-op on the server). A single sticky column per side is unchanged.
- **list — opt-in item connector (timeline / pipeline look).** New `connected` input draws a vertical line between consecutive items (list display only, skipped in cards), themed via `--hub-list-connector-color` / `--hub-list-connector-width` / `--hub-list-connector-style` / `--hub-list-connector-offset`. Default-off — existing lists are unchanged.

### Fixed

- **list (cards) — long labels no longer overflow their card / grid track.** `.hub-list__label` now sets `min-width: 0` so the flex label can shrink to its column; in cards mode a long unbreakable token wraps (`overflow-wrap: anywhere`) instead of blowing out the item and overlapping the adjacent card.

### Changed

- **selectable rows / list items now show a `pointer` cursor on hover.** A `selectable` table row and a `selectable` list item (and card) advertise their interactivity with `cursor: pointer` — previously the pointer only appeared when a `clickFn` was set. Selection behaviour is unchanged (toggled via the checkbox).

## [22.3.1] - 2026-07-02

### Changed

- Hardcoded style values now consume the matching ds tokens (with the ds defaults as fallbacks) — no visual change.
- Docs: `docs/css-variables-reference.md` default values resynchronized with the actual code declarations (now guarded by the repo-level `tokens-parity` check F).

## [22.3.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- **table — automatic client-side pagination.** When `<hub-ui-table>` receives a plain array in `[data]` and `paginate` is `true` (the default) with no `totalItems` provided, the table now searches, filters, sorts and slices the data **entirely in memory** and computes the total itself — mirroring the client-side behaviour of `<hub-list>`. The global search box, sortable headers and every per-column filter (inline "row" filters — text, dropdown, boolean, number-range, date-range — and the advanced "menu" rule engine with AND/OR operators) all resolve client-side, and the page resets/clamps automatically as the result set changes. New internal `TableClientDataService` powers the engine; new public `clientMode`, `clientFilteredRows` and `displayedRows` signals on `TableComponent`.
- **application-wide input defaults via the provider.** `providePaginable()` (and `HubUITableModule.forRoot`) now accepts a `defaults` block — `PaginableDefaults` — to set library-wide default values for component inputs: `paginate`, `perPage`, `perPageOptions`, `paginationPosition`, `paginationInfo`, `searchable` and `debounce`. Any instance `@Input` still overrides them, and keys left unset keep each component's own default (e.g. `paginate` stays `true` for the table and `false` for the list). Example: `providePaginable({ defaults: { perPage: 25, perPageOptions: [25, 50, 100] } })`.

### Changed

- **table — `paginate` input is now functional.** It was previously declared but inert. It now gates the client-side mode described above. Passing a `PaginationState` to `[data]`, or setting `[totalItems]`, keeps the table in server mode (renders `[data]` as-is) exactly as before.

### Migration

- If you currently hand a **full array** to `<hub-ui-table>` expecting **all** rows to render without pagination, set `[paginate]="false"` — otherwise the table will now paginate it in memory (default page size `perPage`, 10). Consumers using server-side pagination (a `PaginationState`, or an array together with `[totalItems]`) are unaffected.

### Fixed

- **Documentation accuracy pass.** Rewrote `FUNCTIONALITIES.md` to separate "Implemented" from "Example available" and corrected stale rows (e.g. server-side pagination, resizable columns, row click, custom filter templates were marked as not covered despite being implemented); removed the non-existent "Ordinal Pipe" entry. Corrected the table's documented API (inputs/outputs) to match the real component: removed invented inputs (`pagination`, `selected`) and outputs (`rowClick`, `selectionChange`, `sortChange`, `filterChange`), documented the actual two-way `model` outputs (`pageChange`, `ordinationChange`, `filtersChange`, `searchTermChange`…) and the `clickFn` input. Fixed the CSS-variables section, whose group headings were rendering raw i18n keys (`DOCS.PAGINABLE.API.CSS_GROUP.*`) because those keys were never defined. Registered six existing-but-unhooked examples (action buttons, column visibility, custom filter templates, empty/error states, resizable columns, row click) and fixed the row-click example, which bound a non-existent `(rowClick)` output instead of the `clickFn` input.
- **`utils.spec.ts`** now imports the migrated helpers from `ng-hub-ui-utils` instead of the local `./utils` (which only re-exports `normalizeStateDefault`), unblocking the library's unit-test compilation.

## [22.2.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- **Agnostic form-controls integration.** The table's primitive controls (global search input, rows-per-page select) can now be rendered by an external component library without `ng-hub-ui-paginable` taking a hard dependency on it. New `HUB_PAGINABLE_FORM_CONTROLS` token, `provideHubPaginableFormControls()` provider, `HubPaginableControlDirective` and the `HubPaginableFormControlsAdapter` / `HubPaginableControlConfig` / `HubPaginableControlHandle` contract. With no adapter the table keeps rendering native `<input>` / `<select>` (zero dependencies); provide one (e.g. `hubFormControlAdapter` from `ng-hub-ui-forms`) and the controls upgrade automatically via dynamic component creation — `provideHubPaginableFormControls(hubFormControlAdapter)`.

## [22.1.3] - 2026-06-26

### Changed

- **table / list:** migrated the semantic accent to the open-set "local accent slot" pattern, aligned with the `ng-hub-ui-ds` engine. `--hub-table-accent` / `--hub-list-accent` now derive a full role family on the spot — `-emphasis` (`color-mix(in oklch, accent 80%, ink)`), `-subtle` (`color-mix(in oklch, accent 12%, surface)`) and `-on` (a grayscale contrast flip via relative-colour syntax). Overriding the single slot at runtime recomputes the whole family with no recompilation, so any accent — including a user-defined one such as `brand` — works through the `hub-table-theme()` / `hub-list-theme()` mixins, a `:host` rule, or `--hub-*-accent: var(--hub-sys-color-brand)`.
- **list:** the selected item now takes its text colour from the derived `--hub-list-accent-on` contrast token (was hard-wired to white), so a light or custom accent keeps the label legible.
- **table / list:** the semantic `variant` set is now the open nine ng-hub-ui-ds variants (`primary`, `secondary`, `success`, `danger`, `warning`, `info`, `neutral`, `light`, `dark`); was five.
- Migrated every `color-mix(in srgb, …)` to `color-mix(in oklch, …)` for perceptually even mixing (`--hub-table-accent-subtle`, `--hub-table-filter-button-active-bg`).

## [22.1.2] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- Design-token consistency pass: aligned inline fallback defaults with the canonical `ng-hub-ui-ds` values and routed hardcoded literals (z-index, font-weight, line-height, radii and theme-aware colours) through their `--hub-sys-*` / `--hub-ref-*` tokens, so they follow the active theme. No visual change when the ds tokens are loaded.

## [22.1.1] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- **list:** native drag-and-drop reordering. Enable it with `[sortable]="true"` on `<hub-list>`; works in the `list` and `cards` layouts and in nested trees. Reorder within a list, between siblings of the same parent, and **between lists** that share a `[dragGroup]` (cross-list transfer). The list reorders its own view optimistically and emits a typed `(sorted)` event — `ListSortEvent<T>` (`{ previousIndex, currentIndex, item, items, isTransfer, previousGroup, group, previousItems?, depth, parentItem }`); only the destination list emits on a cross-list transfer. Built on the native HTML5 drag-and-drop API with a **Pointer Events fallback** for touch/pen devices (floating ghost + edge autoscroll), plus opt-in **keyboard reordering** via `[keyboardSortable]` (Space/Enter to grab and drop, arrows to move, Escape to cancel) with `aria-live` announcements.
    - New projected directives: `HubListDragHandleDirective` (`[hubListDragHandle]` / `[listDragHandle]`) to restrict the drag start to a handle, `HubListDragPlaceholderDirective` (`[hubListDragPlaceholder]` / `[listDragPlaceholder]`) for a custom drop placeholder, and `HubListDragPreviewDirective` (`[hubListDragPreview]` / `[listDragPreview]`) for a custom drag image / touch ghost.
    - New inputs `sortable`, `dragGroup`, `sortDisabled` and `keyboardSortable`; new output `sorted`. New public `HubListDragService` coordinator and `ListSortEvent<T>` interface.
    - New CSS variables: `--hub-list-drag-handle-color/-cursor/-size`, `--hub-list-item-dragging-opacity`, `--hub-list-item-dragging-cursor`, `--hub-list-drop-target-outline-color/-width`, `--hub-list-placeholder-bg/-border-color/-border-width/-border-style/-border-radius/-min-height`, `--hub-list-ghost-opacity/-shadow`.
- **`hub-table-theme()` Sass mixin** (`styles/mixins/table-theme`) — theme a `<hub-table>` in one call: colours (`$accent`, `$bg`, `$color`, `$hover-*`, `$selected-*`, `$striped-*`, `$border-color`), borders (`$border-width`, `$border-radius`), density (`$cell-padding-x/y`) and the footer/bottom-bar layout (`$footer-gap/justify/align/wrap`). Every parameter is optional and defaults to `null`, so only the ones you pass are emitted as `--hub-table-*` overrides; the rest keep their defaults. Token-based, no Bootstrap dependency.
- **`hub-list-theme()` Sass mixin** (`styles/mixins/list-theme`) — the same one-call theming for `<hub-list>` (both `list` and `cards` layouts): colours (`$accent`, `$bg`, `$item-*`, `$hover-bg`, `$selected-*`), borders/radius, item density (`$item-padding-x/y`, `$gap`), the cards grid (`$cards-bg/border-color/border-radius/padding/min-column-width/gap`) and the footer layout. Optional params default to `null` — only the ones you pass are emitted.
- **Semantic `variant` accent** for the table and list (incl. its `cards` display), mirroring panels/nav. Set `options.variant` (`primary` / `success` / `danger` / `warning` / `info`) and the component re-bases a single accent through a CSS loop over the `--hub-sys-color-<variant>` family.
    - **Table**: the **selected row** is now styled (previously the `--selected` class carried no CSS) — it reads as a soft accent tint. New tokens `--hub-table-accent`, `--hub-table-accent-subtle`, `--hub-table-selected-bg`, `--hub-table-selected-color`. `options.variant` keeps applying the existing `.hub-table__<variant>` class, which now re-bases `--hub-table-accent`.
    - **List / cards**: the selected item accent now resolves through the new `--hub-list-accent` (was hard-wired to `--hub-sys-color-primary`). `options.variant` is reflected as `[data-variant]` on the host and re-bases the accent; applies to both the `list` and `cards` display modes.

### Changed

- **tooltip:** `TooltipDirective` moved to `ng-hub-ui-utils` so it can be reused across libraries. It is still re-exported from `ng-hub-ui-paginable` for backward compatibility, but new code should import it from `ng-hub-ui-utils`. The injected base class changed from `.ng-tooltip` to `.hub-tooltip` and tooltips are now themeable via `--hub-tooltip-*` variables.
- **list:** the drag-and-drop engine now lives in the shared `ng-hub-ui-utils` native drag-and-drop core (`HubDragDropService`, array/geometry helpers, drag-image and the Pointer Events fallback). The list re-exports them under the historical names (`HubListDragService`, etc.), so the public API is unchanged; `ng-hub-ui-utils` (already a peer dependency) must be `>=22.3.0`.

## [22.1.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- **states:** application-wide default components for the `loading`, `error` and `no-results` states. Register them through `providePaginable({ states: { loading, error, noResults } })` (or `HubUITableModule.forRoot`). Each accepts a component class, a lazy loader (`() => import(...).then(m => m.Cmp)`) or a full descriptor `{ component, inputs }` whose `inputs` factory maps the runtime context (`colspan`, `error`, `filters`) to the component's `@Input`s. Lazy defaults are pre-resolved at startup via an app initializer.
- **states:** per-instance overrides `[loadingComponent]`, `[errorComponent]` and `[noResultsComponent]` on both `<hub-table>` and `<hub-list>`. Precedence: local directive template → instance `@Input` → global config default → built-in template.
- **table:** consumer-driven `error` model input. When truthy the table renders its (previously dormant) error state.
- **list:** consumer-driven `loading` and `error` model inputs with their own rendered states, plus the no-results state (previously declared but never rendered). The list now reuses the shared loading/error/no-results directives and supports the same default-component system as the table.
- **directives:** the loading and error template directives are now element-agnostic. New generic selectors `paginableLoading` / `paginableError` (the `loadingTpt` / `errorTpt` and `paginableTableLoading` / `paginableTableError` selectors keep working). Classes renamed to `PaginableLoadingDirective` / `PaginableErrorDirective`; the old `PaginableTableLoadingDirective` / `PaginableTableErrorDirective` names remain exported as aliases.
- **api:** `providePaginable`, `PaginableDefaultsService`, `PaginableStateOutlet` and the `PaginableStateDefault` / `PaginableStateComponent` / `PaginableStateContext` / `ResolvedStateDefault` interfaces are now exported.

### Changed

- **config:** `PaginableTableConfig` gains an optional `states` section. `HubUITableModule.forRoot` now delegates to the shared `paginableCoreProviders` set (no behavioral change for existing consumers).
- **tokens:** replaced the `--hub-list-empty-padding` shorthand with the canonical directional `--hub-list-empty-padding-x` / `-y` tokens. No visual change. **BREAKING**: set the `-x`/`-y` tokens instead of the removed shorthand.

## [22.0.1] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed

- **list:** nested children lists were rendered flush against the parent item content. A top margin now separates a nested collection from its parent (in both the default list and card layouts).

### Added

- **list:** `--hub-list-children-gap` CSS variable (defaults to `var(--hub-list-item-padding-y)`) controlling the spacing between a nested children list and its parent item.

## [22.0.0] - 2026-06-17

### Changed

- **list:** reworked the BEM structure so the block lives on the host element. The host `hub-list` now carries the `.hub-list` block class (replacing the `d-flex flex-column gap-4` utilities) and renders the surface background, while the `<ul>` is now the `.hub-list__items` element with a transparent background. Its modifiers were renamed from `.hub-list--root` / `.hub-list--cards` to `.hub-list__items--root` / `.hub-list__items--cards`.
- **list:** the background now applies to the whole component (host) via `--hub-list-bg` instead of the items collection. Both `--hub-list-bg` (host) and `--hub-list-items-bg` (collection) default to `transparent`, so the list no longer paints a surface by default — each item defines itself with its own border. Set `--hub-list-bg` (e.g. `var(--hub-sys-surface-page)`) to render the component as a card.

### Added

- **list:** `--hub-list-gap` (spacing between the top bar, items collection and bottom bar) and `--hub-list-items-bg` (background of the items collection, transparent by default).
- **list:** `--hub-list-item-bg` (defaults to `var(--hub-sys-surface-page)`) so items render as solid surfaces like table rows and adapt to the active theme. Previously the item background was hard-coded to `transparent`. This also wires the previously dangling `--hub-list-cards-bg` default.

### Fixed

- **docs:** corrected the CSS variables reference. Fixed a doubled-prefix typo (`--hub-table-table-*` → `--hub-table-*`) across ~19 table variables, documented the previously missing table search block (`--hub-table-search-*`) and `--hub-table-container-gap`, documented the icon-glyph variables (`--hub-paginator-icon-angle-*`, `--hub-table-icon-sort*`), and brought the Spanish reference (`README`/`css-variables-reference.es.md`) to full parity with the English one (the EN and ES references now document the exact same 207 variables).
- **paginator:** `--hub-paginator-font-size` was defined, documented and overridden in the official examples but never applied. It is now used on the paginator root (`.hub-paginator-container`), so the documented font-size customization takes effect. The default (`var(--hub-ref-font-size-base)`) is unchanged.
- **list:** the `--hub-list-cards-*` CSS variables (`bg`, `color`, `padding-x/y`, `border-color/width/radius`, `shadow`, `hover-bg`, `hover-shadow`, `transition`, `columns`, `row-gap`, `column-gap`) were documented and overridable but never applied — the card layout only honoured `min-column-width` and `gap`, and hard-coded `auto-fit` for the grid columns. They are now wired up on the card items, so the documented cards customization (including the official example) takes effect. Defaults are unchanged, so existing card rendering is identical unless these variables are overridden.

### Removed

- **table:** removed the `--hub-table-breakpoint-sm/md/lg/xl/xxl` CSS variables. They were documented as overridable but had no effect: the responsive variants (`.hub-table__responsive-*`) trigger from `@media` queries with hard-coded pixel values, and CSS custom properties cannot be read inside `@media` conditions. The breakpoints (576/768/992/1200/1400px) are unchanged and remain fixed; the docs now state this explicitly.
- **list:** renamed CSS variables — `--hub-list-container-bg` → `--hub-list-bg`, `--hub-list-container-border-radius` → `--hub-list-border-radius`, `--hub-list-container-padding-x/y` → `--hub-list-padding-x/y`, and `--hub-list-container-gap` → `--hub-list-items-gap`. **Breaking:** update any consumer overrides that used the old `--hub-list-container-*` names or the `.hub-list` / `.hub-list--root` / `.hub-list--cards` selectors.

## [21.5.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- **paginator:** exposed previously hard-coded styles as CSS variables: `--hub-paginator-link-padding-x/y`, `--hub-paginator-link-border-width`, `--hub-paginator-link-focus-shadow`, `--hub-paginator-transition` and `--hub-paginator-select-border-width`.
- **table:** added CSS variables for the filter button geometry (`--hub-table-filter-button-gap`, `--hub-table-filter-button-padding-x/y`, `--hub-table-filter-button-border-width`, `--hub-table-filter-button-border-color`, `--hub-table-filter-button-border-radius`, `--hub-table-filter-button-transition`).
- **table:** added CSS variables for the active-filter count badge (`--hub-table-filter-count-bg`, `--hub-table-filter-count-color`, `--hub-table-filter-count-size`, `--hub-table-filter-count-padding-x`, `--hub-table-filter-count-font-size`, `--hub-table-filter-count-font-weight`, `--hub-table-filter-count-border-radius`).
- **table:** added `--hub-table-batch-actions-btn-icon-gap` for the batch action button icon spacing.

### Changed

- **paginator:** the link `:focus` ring now derives from the design-system tokens `--hub-sys-focus-ring-width` / `--hub-sys-focus-ring-color` instead of a hard-coded Bootstrap blue.
- **table:** the filter button and count badge now read their colors from design-system tokens (`--hub-sys-color-success`, `--hub-sys-text-muted`) instead of the Bootstrap `--bs-success` variable and literal hex values, so they follow the active theme.

## [21.4.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- **list:** added a dedicated set of `--hub-list-cards-*` CSS variables so the card layout can be styled independently from the list layout (`bg`, `color`, `padding-x/y`, `border-color`, `border-width`, `border-radius`, `shadow`, `hover-bg`, `hover-shadow`, `transition`).
- **list:** added `--hub-list-cards-columns` (defaults to `auto-fit`) to allow fixing the number of card columns, plus `--hub-list-cards-row-gap` and `--hub-list-cards-column-gap` for independent grid gaps.
- **list:** added `--hub-list-item-border-width` to expose the previously hard-coded list item border width.

### Changed

- **list:** card items now consume the new `--hub-list-cards-*` variables. Defaults inherit from the existing `--hub-list-item-*` values (and `shadow` defaults to `none`), so the rendered output is unchanged unless the new variables are overridden.

## [21.3.1] - 2026-06-14

### Changed

- Replaced the deprecated `ngStyle` directive with the native `[style]` binding on the table dropdown menu (Angular soft-deprecated `ngStyle`/`ngClass` in November 2024 in favour of native bindings, for better performance and smaller bundles).

## [21.3.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added

- **list:** added `options.display = 'cards'` to render root list items using a card grid layout.
- **styling:** added list card layout tokens for column sizing and card spacing.

### Changed

- **list:** switched root list rendering to a stable tracking key based on `bindValue`, `id`, or index fallback.
- **list:** normalized internal list markup and state classes to support both standard list and card layouts.

### Fixed

- **table:** render the bottom pagination bar only when pagination is enabled, avoiding an empty wrapper.
- **tests:** aligned table action button specs with the unified `PaginableActionButton` contract.

## [21.2.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- **actions:** added library default BEM classes for table/list/dropdown action buttons when no custom class list is provided.
- **styling:** added list action button and top bar CSS variables for consistent customization with table/list layouts.

### Changed

- **api:** removed `color` from `PaginableActionButton` to keep action button configuration CSS-framework agnostic.
- **api:** unified table/list action styling through `classlist` and class normalization helpers.
- **docs:** updated README EN/ES type references from legacy `RowButton`/`ListButton` to `PaginableActionButton`.

### Fixed

- **examples:** migrated table/list action examples to `classlist` instead of implicit Bootstrap classes generated from `color`.
- **rtl:** preserved RTL action ordering behavior while using normalized action class handling.

### Removed

- **interfaces:** removed legacy `row-button.ts` and `list-button.ts` in favor of the unified `PaginableActionButton`.

## [21.1.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- **i18n:** added additional locale dictionaries and updated table/list examples to switch languages dynamically.
- **examples:** added a dedicated bottom bar ordering example for paginable (`table` + `list`).

### Changed

- **bottom bar:** aligned table and list bottom bar structure and behavior (`paginator`, `settings`, `info`) with matching CSS APIs.
- **styling:** introduced mirrored bottom bar layout tokens for table and list, including ordering and flex control.
- **pagination theming:** added context pagination tokens (`--hub-table-pagination-*`, `--hub-list-pagination-*`) and mapped them to paginator styles.
- **docs:** updated README EN/ES styling guidance for context pagination theming and bottom bar layout tokens.

### Fixed

- **list pagination:** normalized per-page handler to support both numeric and event-based updates.
- **examples:** normalized table server-side example snippets to follow the standard tab format used in other paginable examples.

## [21.0.0] - 2026-03-10

### Changed

- **version:** bumped to 21.0.0 to align with Angular 21 update.
- **list:** renamed `PaginableListComponent` to `ListComponent` for consistency.
- **directives:** renamed `PaginableTableNotFoundDirective` to `PaginableNoResultsDirective`.
- **docs:** added `BREAKING_CHANGES.md` to document major version migrations.

## [19.14.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **list:** added per-page selector and pagination info in `ListComponent`.
- **docs:** added `docs/css-variables-reference.es.md` and linked styling docs from README files.

### Changed

- **styles:** consolidated paginable styles around `src/lib/styles/paginable.scss`.
- **docs:** simplified styling sections in `README.md` and `README.es.md` to avoid duplication and point to CSS variables reference.

### Fixed

- **list:** fixed ControlValueAccessor propagation so `ngModel` selected items now match visual selection state.
- **list:** fixed root-level pagination to render only the current page slice.
- **paginator:** fixed missing pagination arrow icons by mapping paginator icon tokens to shared icon variables.

### Removed

- **styles:** removed legacy `src/lib/styles/table.scss`.
- **styles:** removed component-local SCSS files for list and paginator after style consolidation.

## [19.13.0] - 2026-01-12

### Documentation

- **readme:** added "Action Buttons with Reactive Translations" section with i18n example.

## [19.12.0] - 2026-01-03

### Added

### Documentation

- **paginable:** add missing JSDoc documentation to `PaginatorComponent`, `PaginableTableRangeInputComponent`, `MenuFilterComponent`, `ResizableComponent`, and `PaginableTableDropdownComponent`.

### Refactor

- **styles:** refactor row classes in `table.scss` to use `@each` loop for better maintainability and reduced code duplication.

## [19.11.5] - 2026-01-02

### Bug Fixes

- **paginable:** relax stricter type checking on `items` input and internal `_items` property to `any` to allow readonly arrays.
- **interfaces:** update `PaginableTableDropdown`, `ListButton`, and `PaginationState` to accept `ReadonlyArray` for better compatibility with immutable data sources.

### Refactor

- **paginable-list:** migrate `@Input` properties to `input()` signals for `bindValue`, `bindLabel`, `bindChildren`, `selectable`, `clickFn` and content queries.

## [19.11.4] - 2026-01-02
