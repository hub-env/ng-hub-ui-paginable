# Breaking Changes: ng-hub-ui-paginable

## [22.22.0] - 2026-09-08

### `<hub-icon>` no longer matches this package's icon component

- **Change**: the component's selector was `hub-icon, ng-hub-ui-icon` and is now
  `hub-paginable-icon, ng-hub-ui-icon`. The class, exported as `HubIconComponent`, is
  `HubPaginableIconComponent`; the old name is kept as a deprecated alias and is removed in
  23.0.0, the release that moves this family to Angular 23.

- **Why**: `ng-hub-ui-icons` — the package whose whole job is icons — exports a
  `HubIconComponent` matching `hub-icon`. Two components claiming one element name is not a
  preference, it is a hard failure: importing both into the same component and writing
  `<hub-icon>` fails to compile with NG8023, "Multiple components match node with tagname
  hub-icon". Nothing the consumer writes can settle it, because both names come from libraries.
  The tag belongs to the icon package; this one only draws the `Icon` descriptor the table's
  configuration carries.

- **What happens if you do nothing**: a template writing `<hub-icon [config]="…">` and importing
  it from this package stops matching. That is a silent failure — an unmatched element name with
  a `[config]` binding on it is a template error only under `strictTemplates`; otherwise the icon
  simply stops being drawn. `import { HubIconComponent } from 'ng-hub-ui-paginable'` keeps
  compiling, so the import list will not point you here. Check the markup.

- **Migration**: rename the element. `<ng-hub-ui-icon>` has always matched this component too, so
  a codebase already writing that one changes nothing.

    ```html
    <!-- Before -->
    <hub-icon [config]="{ type: 'material', value: 'person' }"></hub-icon>

    <!-- After -->
    <hub-paginable-icon [config]="{ type: 'material', value: 'person' }"></hub-paginable-icon>
    ```

    ```ts
    // Before
    import { HubIconComponent } from 'ng-hub-ui-paginable';

    // After
    import { HubPaginableIconComponent } from 'ng-hub-ui-paginable';
    ```

    If what you actually wanted was the general-purpose icon component — packs, a registry,
    `--hub-icon-*` tokens — that is `HubIconComponent` from `ng-hub-ui-icons`, and `<hub-icon>` is
    now unambiguously its element.

## [22.20.0] - 2026-09-07

### The `TooltipDirective` re-export is removed

- **Change**: this package re-exported `TooltipDirective` from `ng-hub-ui-utils` for backward
  compatibility, the directive having started life here. `ng-hub-ui-utils` 22.14.0 removes it —
  the bare `[tooltip]` selector belonged to the consumer's namespace rather than a library's —
  so the forward has nothing left to point at and goes with it.
- **Impact**: `import { TooltipDirective } from 'ng-hub-ui-paginable'` stops compiling. The
  table's own tooltips are drawn by `HubTableTooltipDirective` and are not affected.
- **Migration**: use `HubTooltipDirective` from `ng-hub-ui-utils`, renaming the attributes:
  `tooltip` → `hubTooltip`, `placement` → `hubTooltipPlacement`, `delay` → `hubTooltipDelay`,
  `offset` → `hubTooltipOffset`. A template left writing `tooltip="…"` compiles and shows
  nothing, so check the markup as well as the imports.

## [22.19.0] - 2026-09-06

### Single selection renders `input[type="radio"]`

- **Change**: with `[selectable]="true"` (or `'single'`) and `[multiple]` left off, the selection cell
  drew `<input type="checkbox">`. It now draws `<input type="radio">`, grouped by a `name` unique to
  that table instance. Multiple selection still draws a checkbox.
- **Impact**: a stylesheet that reaches the box through `input[type="checkbox"]`, or a test that
  queries it that way, stops matching in single-selection tables. Behaviour is unchanged: one row at
  a time, and clicking the chosen row again still clears the pick.
- **Migration**: select the cell rather than the input type, which covers both modes.

    ```scss
    // Before
    .hub-table__cell--select input[type='checkbox'] {
    	accent-color: rebeccapurple;
    }

    // After
    .hub-table__cell--select input {
    	accent-color: rebeccapurple;
    }
    ```

## [22.18.0] - 2026-09-06

### `searchFn` on the table takes an item and a term

- **Change**: `TableComponent.searchFn` was typed `(a: T, b: T) => boolean` and nothing read it. It is now `(item: T, term: string) => boolean`, and the table calls it: in client mode it decides, row by row, what survives the global search. The term arrives already trimmed and lowercased, which is the contract `hub-list.searchFn` has always had — the two components now mean the same thing by "search".
- **Impact**: nothing in this repository, the documentation site included, ever bound it, and no example did either. What breaks is a consumer who wrote the old signature out by hand — a `const search: (a: Order, b: Order) => boolean` handed to `[searchFn]`, or a field typed from `TableComponent['searchFn']`. That stops compiling, which is the point: it was never going to be called with two rows.
- **Migration**: rewrite the predicate to take the row and the term, and return whether the row matches. A comparison of two rows has no equivalent, because the input never had the term it would have needed.

    ```ts
    // Before — declared, never called
    searchFn = (a: Order, b: Order) => a.reference === b.reference;

    // After — one row against the term
    searchFn = (order: Order, term: string) => order.reference.toLowerCase().includes(term);
    ```

- **Also note**: the predicate answers for the whole row, so the searchable columns stop applying while one is bound — that is what makes it able to match on a field the table does not show. It is consulted only in client mode; with a server-managed collection the term is handed to the consumer, who searches wherever the data lives.

### `compareFn` on the table is now read

- **Change**: `TableComponent.compareFn` was declared, documented as pending and never called. It now decides when two selection values are the same record, at every point the table matches the selection against the rows: `markSelected`, and the two toggles.
- **Impact**: **none unless it is bound.** Unbound, the comparisons are byte for byte what they were — JSON serialization in `markSelected`, reference equality in the toggles. A consumer who had left a `compareFn` bound expecting it to be inert now gets a table that obeys it; that is a change in behaviour for a binding whose whole purpose was this.
- **Migration**: none, unless a stray `compareFn` was left bound. Check what it returns before relying on the new behaviour — a comparator that answers `true` too readily merges rows into one selection entry.
- **What it receives**: whatever the table stores in the selection — the row data, or the `bindValue` property when one is set. This mirrors `compareWith` on Angular's own select: the comparison is between values, and `bindValue` is what decides what a value is.

### `HubUITableModule` is deprecated and goes in 23.0.0

- **Change**: `HubUITableModule`, and the `TableModule` alias it is exported under, carry an `@deprecated` tag. **Nothing about their behaviour changes in this release.**
- **Impact**: an editor now marks the import as deprecated, and a build configured to fail on deprecations will say so. The module keeps working exactly as before until it is removed.
- **Migration**: import the standalone components you use directly and replace `HubUITableModule.forRoot(config)` with `providePaginable(config)`, which is the same provider set and also works in a route's `providers`.

    ```ts
    // Before
    imports: [HubUITableModule],
    // …
    HubUITableModule.forRoot({ language: 'es' });

    // After
    imports: [TableComponent],
    // …
    providers: [providePaginable({ language: 'es' })];
    ```

- **When**: `23.0.0`. In this family the major tracks the Angular major, so 23 is the first release that can drop it.

### The last accessor inputs became signal inputs, so reading them from code means calling them

- **Change**: `ListComponent.items`, `ListComponent.options`, `ListComponent.batchActions`, `MenuFilterComponent.header`, `HubIconComponent.config` and `PaginableTableDropdownComponent.options` were `@Input()` accessors and are now `input()` signals. The state their setters used to write by hand is derived with them: `MenuFilterComponent.matchModes` and `defaultValue`, `PaginableTableDropdownComponent.buttonClass` and `toggleColor`, and `HubIconComponent.type`, `value`, `variant`, `classlist` and `content` are all read-only signals now. `MenuFilterComponent.setMatchMode()` and `setDefaultValue()` are gone, having nothing left to set.
- **Impact**: **template bindings are untouched** — `[items]`, `[options]`, `[batchActions]`, `[config]` and the rest bind exactly as before. What breaks is reading or writing those members from TypeScript: `list.items` returns the input signal rather than the array, `icon.classlist` returns a function, and `list.items = […]` no longer compiles. A test that assigned an input directly is the common case.
- **Migration**: call it — `list.items()`, `icon.classlist()`, `dropdown.toggleColor()`. To write one from a test, use `fixture.componentRef.setInput('items', […])`, which worked with the accessors too. `MenuFilterComponent` is not exported from the package, so its two deleted methods were unreachable from outside the library.
- **One behavioural change comes with it**: `ListComponent.options` folds the component defaults back in on every assignment instead of merging into whatever was set before. Passing `{ display: 'cards' }` still gets `collapsed: true`; what changes is that a key you drop from a later assignment now stops applying, where before it lingered.

### The filter panel, the dropdown and the legacy row-actions menu wear this library's names

- **Change**: three components dropped every Bootstrap class name and moved their own blocks under the `hub-` prefix the rest of the package already uses. The filter panel: `.filter__*` → `hub-filter__*`, with `.dropdown-item` → `hub-filter__item`, `.form-control` / `.form-select` → `hub-filter__control` (`--select` on the selects), `.dropdown-divider` → `hub-filter__divider-line`, and the four triggers now `hub-filter__remove-rule`, `hub-filter__add-rule-btn`, `hub-filter__clear`, `hub-filter__apply`. The dropdown: host class `.dropdown` → `hub-dropdown`, `.dropdown__toggle.btn` → `hub-dropdown__toggle`, `.dropdown__menu.dropdown-menu.show` → `hub-dropdown__menu` (`--open` while open). The legacy row-actions menu: `.table-dropdown__*` → `hub-table-dropdown__*`, dropping `.btn`, `.dropdown-toggle`, `.dropdown-menu`, `.dropdown-menu-<position>`, `.dropdown-item` and `.show`; its trigger colour is now painted from `options.color` through `resolveHubAccent` instead of a `.text-<color>` / `.btn-<fill>-<color>` class pair. The table dropped `.btn.btn-outline-dark` from its search button and `.btn.btn-link.px-2` from its row-expander trigger, and the list dropped `.text-danger` from its default error message. Each surface now ships the rules it used to borrow.
- **Impact**: CSS that reached any of those internals through the old names no longer matches — `.filter__actions__apply`, `.table-dropdown__item`, `hub-table .dropdown-menu`, `.hub-table__expander-btn.btn-link`, `.hub-list__error.text-danger`. A `classlist` on a dropdown action that used the `table-dropdown__` prefix to opt out of the default item class must say `hub-table-dropdown__` now, or it will be given `hub-table-dropdown__item--default` alongside it. Bootstrap consumers see the library's own panel instead of Bootstrap's; same shape, and no longer repainted by a theme change in the application.
- **Migration**: rename the selector — every old name maps to exactly one new name in the list above. There is no compatibility class to fall back on, by design: two owners of one appearance is the state this release exists to end.
- **Also renamed**: the internal `<menu-filter>` element is `<hub-menu-filter>`. `MenuFilterComponent` has never been exported from the package's public API, so nothing outside the library could have been using it; the rename is listed here only because the element name was global while it existed.

## v22.17.0

### The column filters and the clear-filters button no longer wear Bootstrap class names

- **Change**: the default filter controls dropped `.form-control` / `.form-select` for `hub-table__filter-control` (`--select` on the two selects), and the clear-filters button dropped `.btn.btn-outline-danger`. Each is now drawn from `--hub-table-filter-control-*` / `--hub-table-delete-filters-*`. The range control dropped three sets: `.form-control d-flex flex-column` on its root, `d-flex align-items-center justify-content-between` on each field, and `.text-muted` on each label.
- **Impact**: CSS that reached the filter row through those names — `.hub-table__filter-cell .form-control`, `.hub-table__delete-filters-btn.btn-outline-danger` — no longer matches. Bootstrap consumers see the library's field instead of Bootstrap's; the two are the same shape, but the clear button is now neutral at rest and destructive only on hover.
- **Migration**: theme through the tokens (`--hub-table-filter-control-border-color`, `--hub-table-delete-filters-hover-bg`, …), or target `.hub-table__filter-control` / `.hub-table__delete-filters-btn`. To keep the old red-at-rest button: `--hub-table-delete-filters-color: var(--hub-sys-color-danger); --hub-table-delete-filters-border-color: var(--hub-sys-color-danger);`.
- **Why not keep both**: the names promised a stylesheet this family does not ship, so in a product without Bootstrap the whole filter row was invisible — the bug this release fixes. Keeping them would leave two owners of one appearance, free to drift apart, and the library's own rules would have to out-specify a stylesheet it cannot see.

### The range control no longer ships a `.form-control` compatibility block

- **Change**: `paginable-table-range-input.component.scss` carried a `// Legacy support for form-control` rule that gave anything inside a `.form-control` the range control's own layout. It is deleted.
- **Impact**: this is the vector the entry above does not cover, and it reaches further. A **custom filter template** of your own — `filterTpt` markup wrapped in `.form-control`, which is exactly what this library's own README has been instructing — inherited that block and now inherits nothing. The control keeps its shape; a hand-written template that leaned on the block loses its layout.
- **Migration**: give your template its own layout, or reach for `.hub-table__filter-control`, which the library now styles. The README snippets are corrected in this release, so copying them afresh produces markup that works in a product with or without Bootstrap.
- **Why**: the block existed to make a Bootstrap name work inside a library that no longer emits one. Keeping a compatibility shim for a class the library has stopped writing means maintaining an appearance nobody owns.

### Rebuilding `items` keeps the whole selection and publishes nothing

- **Change**: the `items` setter no longer recomputes the value from what survived the rebuild, and no longer calls `onChange`. What was written into the control stays written; only the part of it that the new items can show is ticked.
- **Impact**: a consumer that paged or filtered its own data and relied on the list pruning the value for it now keeps entries that are not on the current page. A consumer that listened for that publication to learn "the selection shrank" no longer hears it — which is the point: it was indistinguishable from the user clearing the field.
- **Migration**: prune on the consumer's side, where the reason for the change is known. If the offer really shrank (an item was deleted), intersect the value with the new items and write it back. If it only paged, do nothing — which is what most callers wanted and could not get.
- **Why not an option**: a flag would ask every consumer to answer a question the library cannot pose properly. The distinction is not "prune or not", it is "why did `items` change", and only the caller holds that.

## v22.12.0

### `clickFn` hands over the item, not the internal wrapper

- **Change**: `ListClickEvent.item` now carries the list item you passed in `items`. It used to carry the form group wrapping it — `{selected, collapsed, data, children}` — while the published type said `item: T`. `value` now reads `bindLabel` from the item rather than from that wrapper, and a new `children: T[]` carries a group's children as items.
- **Impact**: code written against the **runtime** rather than the type — reading `event.item.data`, or `event.item.children` expecting wrappers — breaks. Code written against the **published type** — `event.item.<field>` — starts working, having silently received `undefined` until now.
- **Migration**: delete the unwrapping. `event.item.data` becomes `event.item`; `event.item.children.map(c => c.data)` becomes `event.children`. A consumer that defended against both shapes (`item.data ?? item`) needs no change.
- **Why not an alias**: adding `event.row` and deprecating `item` would leave the library carrying a field that is documented as the item and is not, for ever, to protect code that depends on a contradiction between the runtime and the type. One name, correct, is the cheaper price — and it is paid once.

### A group row no longer contributes its own value to the selection

- **Change**: with `bindChildren`, ticking a group's checkbox now selects **its children**, and the group's own value no longer enters the selection. A group whose children are partly selected renders indeterminate.
- **Impact**: a consumer who relied on a group's value appearing in the array — treating a heading as a selectable datum — gets the leaves instead.
- **Migration**: read the leaves. If a group genuinely is a datum in your data, it should not have `children`.

## v22.1.1

### Tooltip directive moved to `ng-hub-ui-utils`

- **Change**: `TooltipDirective` now lives in `ng-hub-ui-utils`. It is still re-exported from `ng-hub-ui-paginable` for backward compatibility, so existing imports keep working. The injected base class changed from `.ng-tooltip` to `.hub-tooltip`.
- **Impact**: any custom CSS targeting `.ng-tooltip` no longer applies.
- **Migration**: import `TooltipDirective` from `ng-hub-ui-utils`, and restyle via the new `.hub-tooltip` class or the `--hub-tooltip-*` CSS variables. Requires `ng-hub-ui-utils >= 22.2.0`.

## v22.0.0

This release aligns the major with Angular 22 and restructures the List component's CSS API. `peerDependencies` stays at `>=18.0.0`, so Angular 18–22 remain supported.

### 1. List BEM structure moved to the host element

- **Change**: the `.hub-list` block class now lives on the host element (`<hub-list>`); the inner `<ul>` is now `.hub-list__items`. The root/cards modifiers were renamed from `.hub-list--root` / `.hub-list--cards` to `.hub-list__items--root` / `.hub-list__items--cards`.
- **Impact**: CSS targeting `.hub-list` as the `<ul>`, or the `.hub-list--root` / `.hub-list--cards` selectors, no longer matches.
- **Migration**: target `.hub-list__items` (and `--root` / `--cards`) for the items collection; `.hub-list` now refers to the component host.

### 2. List CSS variables renamed

- **Change**:
    - `--hub-list-container-bg` → `--hub-list-bg`
    - `--hub-list-container-border-radius` → `--hub-list-border-radius`
    - `--hub-list-container-padding-x` / `-y` → `--hub-list-padding-x` / `-y`
    - `--hub-list-container-gap` → `--hub-list-items-gap`
- **Impact**: overrides using the old `--hub-list-container-*` names have no effect.
- **Migration**: rename the variables in your overrides. The background model also changed: `--hub-list-bg` (host) and `--hub-list-item-bg` (items) now control backgrounds; the host is transparent and items use the page surface by default.

### 3. Table responsive breakpoint variables removed

- **Change**: `--hub-table-breakpoint-sm` / `-md` / `-lg` / `-xl` / `-xxl` were removed.
- **Impact**: none in practice — they never had any effect, because CSS custom properties cannot be read inside `@media` conditions.
- **Migration**: none. The responsive variants (`.hub-table__responsive-*`) still trigger at the fixed `576px` / `768px` / `992px` / `1200px` / `1400px` breakpoints.

## v21.2.0

This major release removes framework-specific styling assumptions from action buttons and unifies the action button contract.

### 1. `PaginableActionButton.color` removed

- **Change**: `color` is no longer part of `PaginableActionButton`.
- **Impact**: Configurations that relied on automatic Bootstrap class generation (`btn-${color}` or `text-${color}`) must now provide classes explicitly.
- **Migration**: Move style intent to `classlist`.

```typescript
// Before
{
  title: 'Delete',
  color: 'danger'
}

// After
{
  title: 'Delete',
  classlist: 'btn btn-danger'
}
```

### 2. Legacy action interfaces removed

- **Change**: `RowButton` and `ListButton` have been removed.
- **Migration**: Replace all usages with `PaginableActionButton`.

```typescript
// Before
buttons: Array<RowButton | PaginableTableDropdown>;
batchActions: Array<PaginableTableDropdown | ListButton>;

// After
buttons: Array<PaginableActionButton | PaginableTableDropdown>;
batchActions: Array<PaginableTableDropdown | PaginableActionButton>;
```

## v21.0.0

This major release aligns with Angular 21 and introduces structural renaming to improve consistency across the library.

### 2. Component Renaming

- **Change**: `PaginableListComponent` has been renamed to `ListComponent`.
- **Migration**: Update your imports and component references:

    ```typescript
    // Before
    import { PaginableListComponent } from 'ng-hub-ui-paginable';

    // After
    import { ListComponent } from 'ng-hub-ui-paginable';
    ```

### 3. Directive Renaming

- **Change**: The empty state directive `PaginableTableNotFoundDirective` has been renamed to `PaginableNoResultsDirective`.
- **Migration**: Update your template and imports:

    ```html
    <!-- Before -->
    <ng-template paginableTableNotFound> No results found. </ng-template>

    <!-- After -->
    <ng-template paginableNoResults> No results found. </ng-template>
    ```
